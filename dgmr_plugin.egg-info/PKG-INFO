In a previous study by Ravuri et al., DGMR has been showed to perform better than pySTEPS and some other nowcasting solutions. 
This study was run with radar precipitation data from the United Kingdom that was used to train and test the model, 
and a test run using data from the United States (Ravuri et al., 2021).
