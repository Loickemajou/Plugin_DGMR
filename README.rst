pysteps-dgmr-nowcasts

This is a Python package that provides a deep learning model for performing nowcasting on radar images using the DGMR (Generative Method for Radar) model.

Features
Implements the state-of-the-art DGMR model for weather nowcasting
Leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce high-resolution, realistic rainfall forecasts
Supports preprocessing of input frames to match the expected format of the DGMR model
Provides a forecast function to generate rainfall predictions given input frames
Installation
Install the pysteps-dgmr package using pip:
bash
pip install pysteps-dgmr-nowcasts

The package will automatically download the pre-trained DGMR model weights and cache them for future use.
Usage
python
from pysteps.nowcasts.dgmr import forecast

# Prepare input frames (4, 256, 256, 1)
input_frames = ...

# Generate 10 samples of 18 predicted frames
samples = forecast(input_frames, num_samples=10)

The forecast function takes preprocessed input frames (4, 256, 256, 1) and generates rainfall predictions. It returns a tensor of shape (num_samples, T_out, H, W, C), where T_out is the number of predicted frames (18 or 22, depending on the include_input_frames_in_result parameter).
For more details on the DGMR model and its implementation, please refer to the pysteps documentation.
