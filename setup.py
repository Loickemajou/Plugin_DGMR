    # Entry points
    # ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    #
    # This is the most important part of the plugin setup script.
    # Entry points are a mechanism for an installed python distribution to advertise
    # some of the components installed (packages, modules, and scripts) to other
    # applications (in our case, pysteps).
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/
    #
    # An entry point is defined by three properties:
    # - The group that an entry point belongs indicate the kind of functionality that
    #   provides. For the pysteps importers use the "pysteps.plugins.importers" group.
    # - The unique name that is used to identify this entry point in the
    #   "pysteps.plugins.importers" group.
    # - A reference to a Python object. For the pysteps importers, the object should
    #   point to a importer function, and should have the following form:
    #   package_name.module:function.
    # The setup script uses a dictionary mapping the entry point group names to a list
    # of strings defining the importers provided by this package (our plugin).
    # The general form of the entry points dictionary is:
    # entry_points={
    #     "group_name": [
    #         "entry_point_name=package_name.module:function",
    #         "entry_point_name=package_name.module:function2",
    #     ]
    # },
    # For this particular example, the entry points are defined as:
    entry_points={
        'pysteps.plugins.nowcasts': [
            'dgmr=dgmr_module_plugin.dgmr:forecast',

        ]
    },
    version="0.1.0",  # Indicate the version of the plugin
